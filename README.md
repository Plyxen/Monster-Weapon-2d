# ⚔️ Monster Weapon 2D - Dungeon Crawler ⚔️

## ⚠️ **DISCONTINUED PROJECT** ⚠️

A simple dungeon crawler game with sword combat and skeleton enemies built with Python and Pygame.

## 🔚 Project Status

This Python version is finished. Python and Pygame have limitations for this type of game, so I'm starting over with Unity + C# to make a better version with:
- Better graphics and animations
- Better performance
- Same concept: dungeon crawler with skeletons and sword combat

This Python version was good practice and shows the basic game mechanics.
