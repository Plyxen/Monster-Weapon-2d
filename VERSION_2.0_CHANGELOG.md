## Overview
Major update focusing on bug fixes, gameplay balance, and code organization.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Enemy Room Teleportation (FIXED)
**Issue**: Enemies were following players between rooms, breaking the room-based combat system.

**Solution**:
- Added `spawn_room` attribute to Monster class
- Monsters now check room boundaries in `update_position()`
- Enemies cannot leave their spawn room (proper Isaac-style behavior)
- Removed corridor enemies entirely

**Files Changed**:
- `GameEntities.py`: Added spawn_room check in Monster.update_position()
- `MazeGame.py`: Set monster.spawn_room when spawning, removed corridor monsters

### 2. Invincibility Frames Not Working (FIXED)
**Issue**: Player was getting "one-tapped" - taking multiple hits instantly from the same enemy.

**Solution**:
- Verified `Player.take_damage()` properly checks `invincibility_frames`
- Increased invincibility duration from 60 to 90 frames (1.5 seconds)
- Added `INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES` constant to GameConstants.py

**Files Changed**:
- `GameConstants.py`: Added INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES = 90
- `GameEntities.py`: Player uses INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES constant

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Changes

### Speed Reductions (~40% Slower)
All speeds reduced to make gameplay more tactical and less frantic.

#### Player
| Stat | Old Value | New Value | Change |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Movement Speed | 0.15 | 0.08 | -47% |
| Bullet Speed | 6.0 | 4.0 | -33% |
| Fire Rate | 15 frames | 20 frames | +33% slower |

#### Enemies
| Enemy Type | Old Speed | New Speed | Change |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| FLY | 0.12 | 0.07 | -42% |
| GAPER | 0.08 | 0.05 | -38% |
| SHOOTER | 0.05 | 0.03 | -40% |
| TANK | 0.04 | 0.025 | -38% |
| SPEEDY | 0.15 | 0.09 | -40% |
| CHARGER (base) | 0.06 | 0.04 | -33% |
| CHARGER (boost) | 0.14 | 0.08 | -43% |

#### Enemy Bullets
| Stat | Old Value | New Value | Change |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Bullet Speed | 3.0 | 2.5 | -17% |
| Shoot Cooldown | 90 frames | 120 frames | +33% slower |

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Organization

### Constants Consolidation
**Goal**: Move all magic numbers and constants to GameConstants.py

**New Constants Added**:
```python
# Player
PLAYER_SPEED = 0.08
PLAYER_SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 20
PLAYER_BULLET_SPEED = 4.0
INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES = 90

# Enemy Speeds
ENEMY_SPEED_FLY = 0.07
ENEMY_SPEED_GAPER = 0.05
ENEMY_SPEED_SHOOTER = 0.03
ENEMY_SPEED_TANK = 0.025
ENEMY_SPEED_SPEEDY = 0.09
ENEMY_SPEED_CHARGER = 0.04
ENEMY_SPEED_CHARGER_BOOST = 0.08

# Enemy Bullets
ENEMY_BULLET_SPEED = 2.5
ENEMY_SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 120
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for all game values
- Easy to tweak balance without hunting through code
- Clear, organized, and documented
- No more magic numbers scattered in files

**Files Changed**:
- `GameConstants.py`: Added all speed and combat constants
- `GameEntities.py`: Now uses constants from GameConstants
- `MazeGame.py`: Imports and uses GameConstants

- Comprehensive class docstring for EnhancedMazeGame
- Method documentation with parameters and behavior

**GameConstants.py**:
- Already well-documented
- Clear section headers
- Inline comments for all constants

### Updated README.md
- Added Version 2.0 section highlighting new changes
- Listed bug fixes prominently
- Explained balance changes
- Noted code organization improvements

### Updated GAME_SUMMARY.md
- Added "Latest Updates (v2.0)" section

## üéÆ Gameplay Impact

### More Tactical Combat
- Slower movement allows better positioning
- Enemy patterns are easier to read and react to
- Player has time to aim shots more carefully

### Proper Room-Based Design
- Enemies stay in rooms (true Isaac-style)
- No surprise corridor ambushes
- Clear room completion goals

### Fair Difficulty
- Invincibility frames prevent cheap deaths
- Players have time to recover after taking damage
- Balanced risk/reward for room clearing

- **GameEntities.py**: ~20 lines modified (constants + spawn_room)
- **MazeGame.py**: ~10 lines modified (spawn_room assignment, removed corridor spawn)
- **Documentation**: ~100 lines added across README and GAME_SUMMARY

### No Breaking Changes
All changes are backwards compatible with existing code structure.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

Potential areas for future updates:
1. Boss health bars (for boss rooms)
2. More enemy variety (ranged patterns, area attacks)
3. Power-up items (speed boost, damage boost, etc.)
4. Room modifiers (curse rooms, angel rooms)
5. Sound effects and music
6. Particle effects for bullets/impacts

## üìå Summary

Version 2.0 successfully addresses player feedback by:
- **Fixing critical bugs** (enemy teleportation, invincibility)
- **Balancing gameplay** (slower, more tactical combat)
- **Organizing code** (constants in one place)
- **Improving documentation** (clear, concise, helpful)

The game now plays exactly as intended: a balanced, fair, tactical Isaac-like roguelike with proper room-based combat and clear progression.

**Recommended for all players!** üéÆ
