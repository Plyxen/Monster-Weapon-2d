## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Enemy Room Teleportation (FIXED)
**Issue**: Enemies were following players between rooms, breaking the room-based combat system.

**Solution**:
- Added `spawn_room` attribute to Monster class
- Monsters now check room boundaries in `update_position()`
- Enemies cannot leave their spawn room (proper Isaac-style behavior)
- Removed corridor enemies entirely

**Files Changed**:
- `GameEntities.py`: Added spawn_room check in Monster.update_position()
- `MazeGame.py`: Set monster.spawn_room when spawning, removed corridor monsters

### 2. Invincibility Frames Not Working (FIXED)
**Issue**: Player was getting "one-tapped" - taking multiple hits instantly from the same enemy.

**Solution**:
- Verified `Player.take_damage()` properly checks `invincibility_frames`
- Increased invincibility duration from 60 to 90 frames (1.5 seconds)
- Added `INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES` constant to GameConstants.py

**Files Changed**:
- `GameConstants.py`: Added INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES = 90
- `GameEntities.py`: Player uses INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES constant

## üé® Visual Improvements

### Pixel Art System Refactor
**Goal**: Create a centralized, modular pixel art asset system for better organization and future expansion.

#### Treasure Room Icon Enhancement
**Old Design**: Gold crown with red jewels  
**New Design**: Bright yellow crown with light yellow highlights

**Visual Changes**:
- Changed base color from gold to pure yellow (`COLORS['YELLOW']`)
- Replaced red jewel accents with bright yellow highlights `(255, 255, 150)`
- Improved visibility on minimap
- More vibrant and eye-catching appearance

**Pixel Art Pattern** (7x7 grid):
```
  Crown Points:  [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]  (Bright yellow tips)
  Crown Tips:    [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  Top Band:      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  (Yellow base)
  Decorative:    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]  (Bright yellow pattern)
  Middle Band:   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Base:          [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  Bottom Shine:  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]  (Bright yellow base)
```

Where:
- `1` = Yellow base color `COLORS['YELLOW']`
- `2` = Light yellow highlights `(255, 255, 150)`

### New Pixel Art Asset System
**Created**: `PixelArtAssets.py` - Centralized module for all game visual assets

**Features**:
- **RoomIcons Class**: All minimap room icons (Boss, Treasure, Shop, Secret, Super Secret)
- **PixelArtRenderer Class**: Utility for drawing pixel art on surfaces
- **Preview System**: Built-in tool to view all icons (run `python PixelArtAssets.py`)
- **Future-Ready**: Organized structure for items, UI elements, and effects

**Room Icons Included**:
1. **Boss Room**: Red skull with black eyes and teeth
2. **Treasure Room**: Bright yellow crown ‚≠ê (NEW COLORS)
3. **Shop Room**: Brown money bag with gold dollar sign
4. **Secret Room**: Purple background with white question mark
5. **Super Secret Room**: Cyan sparkle with white highlights

**Benefits**:
- Removed ~240 lines of duplicate code from `MazeGame.py`
- Single source of truth for all pixel art
- Easy to add new visual assets
- Professional asset management system
- Built-in preview tool for designing

**Files Created**:
- `PixelArtAssets.py` - Main pixel art module (300+ lines)
- `preview_pixel_art.bat` - Quick preview launcher
- `PIXEL_ART_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation for adding new assets

**Code Cleanup**:
- Extracted helper methods `_draw_pixel_art_icon()` and `_get_room_icon_data()` 
- Replaced with clean `PixelArtRenderer.draw_room_icon()` calls
- Minimap drawing code reduced by ~73%

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Organization

### Constants Consolidation
**Goal**: Move all magic numbers and constants to GameConstants.py

**New Constants Added**:
```python
# Player
PLAYER_SPEED = 0.08
PLAYER_SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 20
PLAYER_BULLET_SPEED = 4.0
INVINCIBILITY_FRAMES = 90

# Enemy Speeds
ENEMY_SPEED_FLY = 0.07
ENEMY_SPEED_GAPER = 0.05
ENEMY_SPEED_SHOOTER = 0.03
ENEMY_SPEED_TANK = 0.025
ENEMY_SPEED_SPEEDY = 0.09
ENEMY_SPEED_CHARGER = 0.04
ENEMY_SPEED_CHARGER_BOOST = 0.08

# Enemy Bullets
ENEMY_BULLET_SPEED = 2.5
ENEMY_SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 120
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for all game values
- Easy to tweak balance without hunting through code
- Clear, organized, and documented
- No more magic numbers scattered in files

**Files Changed**:
- `GameConstants.py`: Added all speed and combat constants
- `GameEntities.py`: Now uses constants from GameConstants
- `MazeGame.py`: Imports and uses GameConstants
